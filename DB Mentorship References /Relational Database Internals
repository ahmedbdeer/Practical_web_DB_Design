Relational Database Internals â€“ Reference Guide
This guide summarizes the contents of the Relational_Database_Internals directory from the TechVault GitHub repository. It provides a structured overview of fundamental database components and mechanisms.

1. B+ Tree Index
Concept:

A B+ Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure used for indexing in relational databases.
It improves query performance by reducing the number of disk accesses.
Key Topics Covered:

Structure of B+ Trees: Root, internal nodes, and leaf nodes.
Insertion and Deletion: How records are added and removed while maintaining balance.
Search Operations: Efficient retrieval using logarithmic complexity (O(log n)).
Advantages Over Binary Trees: Better disk performance due to balanced nature and fewer disk accesses.
Use Cases in Databases:

Indexing primary keys in tables.
Speeding up searches in large datasets.
Used in MySQL (InnoDB), PostgreSQL, and SQL Server indexing mechanisms.
2. Buffer Pool
Concept:

The buffer pool is a memory cache used to store frequently accessed database pages.
It helps reduce disk I/O operations by keeping hot data in RAM.
Key Topics Covered:

Page Management: How the database loads and evicts pages.
Replacement Policies: LRU (Least Recently Used), MRU (Most Recently Used), and other algorithms.
Dirty Pages & Write-Backs: When and how modified pages are written back to disk.
Use Cases in Databases:

Performance optimization: Reducing latency by keeping frequently accessed data in memory.
Transaction management: Ensuring efficient reads/writes in concurrent environments.
Found in MySQL (InnoDB buffer pool), PostgreSQL (shared buffers), and Oracle Databases.
3. Concurrency Control
Concept:

Concurrency control ensures that multiple users can access the database without conflicts.
It prevents issues like dirty reads, lost updates, and inconsistent data states.
Key Topics Covered:

ACID Properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
Locking Mechanisms:
Pessimistic Locking: Prevents conflicts by locking resources.
Optimistic Locking: Assumes minimal conflicts and verifies before committing.
Isolation Levels: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable.
Deadlock Detection and Prevention: How databases handle deadlocks between transactions.
Use Cases in Databases:

Handling multiple transactions simultaneously.
Ensuring consistency in banking transactions, inventory management, and high-traffic applications.
Used in PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle DB.
4. Data Storage
Concept:

How relational databases store tables, records, and indexes on disk.
Focuses on efficient retrieval, updates, and data integrity.
Key Topics Covered:

Heap Files vs. Index-Organized Tables: How databases store raw data.
Page & Block Structures: How records are grouped in pages for efficient disk access.
Row-Based vs. Column-Based Storage:
Row-based: Optimized for transactional workloads (OLTP).
Column-based: Optimized for analytical workloads (OLAP).
Use Cases in Databases:

Storing and retrieving relational data efficiently.
Found in PostgreSQL (Heap Tables), MySQL (InnoDB Tablespaces), and Oracle (Data Blocks & Segments).
5. Logging and Recovery
Concept:

Databases maintain logs to recover from crashes and ensure data consistency.
The Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) protocol ensures that logs are written before changes are committed.
Key Topics Covered:

Transaction Logging: How every change is logged before it is committed.
Crash Recovery Mechanisms:
Redo Logs: Used to replay committed transactions.
Undo Logs: Used to roll back uncommitted transactions.
Checkpoints: Periodic database snapshots for faster recovery.
Use Cases in Databases:

Ensuring durability of transactions.
Restoring data after system crashes.
Used in PostgreSQL WAL, MySQL Binary Logs, and Oracle Redo/Undo Logs.
6. Query Optimization
Concept:

The query optimizer transforms SQL queries into efficient execution plans.
It minimizes CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage for better performance.
Key Topics Covered:

Parsing & Logical Optimization: How SQL queries are analyzed.
Execution Plans: How the database chooses the best strategy for running queries.
Index Selection & Join Strategies: How indexes speed up lookups and joins.
Cost-Based vs. Rule-Based Optimization:
Cost-Based: Uses statistics to estimate the best plan.
Rule-Based: Uses predefined heuristics.
Use Cases in Databases:

Speeding up SELECT, JOIN, and AGGREGATION queries.
Used in PostgreSQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE, MySQL Optimizer, and SQL Server Query Execution Plans.
