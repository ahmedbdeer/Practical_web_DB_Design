## 1. Data Model

A **data model** is a conceptual framework used to organize, define, and manage data in a structured and meaningful way. It serves as a blueprint for how data is stored, accessed, and related.

### Three Critical Components

#### Structure
- **Definition:** How data is organized and represented (schema, tables, columns, relationships, constraints).
- **Purpose:** Provides a clear and efficient foundation for data storage and retrieval.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (
      user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100),
      email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
  );

  CREATE TABLE orders (
      order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      user_id INT,
      order_date DATE,
      FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
  );
Integrity
Definition: Ensures the consistency and validity of data through rules, constraints, and relationships.
Purpose: Maintains data trustworthiness over time.
Example:
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (price > 0)
);

CREATE TABLE inventory (
    product_id INT,
    stock INT CHECK (stock >= 0),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);

Operations
Definition: Methods to manipulate the data (querying, inserting, updating, deleting).
Purpose: Provides mechanisms to interact with data effectively.
Example:
-- Insert data
INSERT INTO users (user_id, name, email) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com');

-- Query data
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Update data
UPDATE users SET email = 'john.doe@example.com' WHERE user_id = 1;

-- Delete data
DELETE FROM users WHERE user_id = 1;

Summary Table
Aspect	Definition	Example
Structure	Organization of data (tables, columns, relationships)	Tables like users and orders with foreign key relationships
Integrity	Data consistency and validity (constraints, rules)	NOT NULL, CHECK, FOREIGN KEY constraints
Operations	Methods to manipulate and query data	SQL operations: INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE

2. Physical vs. Logical Data Structures
Physical Data Structures
Definition: The actual representation of data on storage media (disk, memory).
Terminology: File, Record, Field.
Logical Data Structures
Definition: Abstract representation of data within a database.
Terminology: Table, Row, Column.
Reference: Practical Web DB Design

3. Differences and Relationship Between URL, URI, and XML
URL (Uniform Resource Locator): Specifies the address of a resource on the web.
URI (Uniform Resource Identifier): A broader identifier that includes both URLs and URNs.
XML (eXtensible Markup Language): A markup language for encoding documents in a both human- and machine-readable format.
Reference: T-Point Tech on DBMS Heap File Organization

4. ENUM and LOOKUP in Database Tables
ENUM: A data type that restricts a column to one of a set of predefined values.
LOOKUP: Often implemented as a separate table that stores valid values; used to enforce data integrity via foreign keys.
5. Pagination and Search
Pagination: Dividing a large dataset into discrete pages for easier navigation and performance.
Search: Query techniques to filter and locate data based on criteria.
Reference: SQLBolt

6. Server-Side, Backend, and Frontend
Server-Side/Backend: Manages business logic, data processing, and database interactions.
Frontend: The client-side interface that users interact with.
Reference: YouTube Playlist on Web Development

7. Understanding DBMS (Database Management System)
A DBMS is software that creates, manages, and interacts with databases, providing tools for data storage, retrieval, and security.

Reference: Practical Web DB Design on GitHub

8. Real-Life Examples of Database Models
Examples include:

Relational Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
NoSQL Databases: MongoDB.
Hierarchical/Network Models: Used in legacy systems.
9. Database Models Overview
Overview of common models:

Relational Model: Organizes data into tables with predefined relationships.
Document Model: Uses document structures (e.g., JSON) to store data.
Graph Model: Uses nodes and relationships to represent data.
Key-Value Model: Stores data as key-value pairs.
10. Recursive Relationships in Database Design
A recursive relationship occurs when an entity relates to itself. This is common in hierarchical data such as organizational structures or category trees.

11. Access Controls: Read-Only vs. Insert/Update Logins
Read-Only Access: For users who only need to view data.
Insert/Update Access: For users or processes that modify data.
The choice depends on the required operations and user roles.

12. Database Performance Tuning
Improving performance by optimizing physical storage and query execution:

Techniques: Hardware tuning, indexing, query optimization, partitioning.
Goals: Reduce query response times and improve throughput.
Reference: MySQL Indexing Best Practices

13. Indexes in Relational Databases
Indexes enhance data retrieval efficiency:

Types: B-Tree, Composite, Covering indexes.
Best Practices: Understand when and how to create effective indexes.
Reference: YouTube Video on SQL Indexing
Reference: pgExplain.dev

14. Referential Integrity
Ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent, typically enforced using foreign keys and constraints.

15. Views vs. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Views: Virtual tables created by a stored query.
CTEs: Temporary result sets defined within a query for clarity and recursive operations.
16. Emulating SET NULL with Triggers
Using triggers to mimic the SET NULL action on foreign keys when a related record is modified or deleted.

17. Using Views in the Database
Views provide an abstraction layer, simplifying complex queries and improving security by limiting direct table access.

18. Advanced Insights into Database Locking
Understanding locking mechanisms is crucial to avoid deadlocks and performance bottlenecks during concurrent transactions.

Reference: YouTube Playlist on Database Locking

19. Composite vs. Covering Indexes
Composite Index: An index on multiple columns.
Covering Index: An index that includes all columns required by a query, avoiding additional lookups.
Reference: Medium Article on Composite Indices

20. How SQL Works (Query Execution)
An overview of SQL query processing:

Steps: Parsing, optimizing, executing, and returning results.
Focus: How indexes, joins, and query plans affect performance.
Reference: YouTube Playlist on SQL Execution

21. Index SQL
Discusses the creation and use of indexes in SQL to improve query performance, including best practices and common pitfalls.
